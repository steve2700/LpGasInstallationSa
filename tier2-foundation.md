## What is a Gas Certificate of Compliance? (400 words)

A Gas Certificate of Compliance (COC) is a mandatory legal document required by South African law for all gas installations. Also known as a gas compliance certificate, this document confirms that your gas installation meets the safety standards outlined in SANS 10087-1 and complies with all regulations set by the South African Qualifications and Certification Committee for Gas (SAQCC Gas).

The gas COC certifies that:
- All gas installations are safe and properly installed
- Gas appliances are correctly connected and ventilated
- There are no gas leaks or safety hazards
- The installation meets current South African building and safety codes
- Gas pressure and flow rates are correct

Think of a gas COC as a safety report card for your gas installation. It protects you, your family, and future property owners by ensuring everything is installed correctly and safely.

## When Do You Need a Gas Certificate of Compliance? (300 words)

South African law requires a gas COC in several situations:

### New Gas Installations
Whenever you install a new gas appliance (geyser, stove, fireplace, or braai), you must obtain a COC within 30 days of installation. This applies to both residential and commercial properties.

### Selling Your Property
If your property has gas installations, you must provide a valid gas COC to the buyer before transfer. No COC means no sale - conveyancers and banks will not process the transfer without this document. The COC must be issued within 2 years of the sale date.

### Property Alterations
Any modifications, additions, or changes to existing gas installations require a new COC. This includes moving appliances, adding new gas points, or upgrading systems.

### Insurance Claims
Many insurance companies require a valid gas COC before processing claims related to gas appliances or installations.

### Rental Properties
Landlords must ensure all gas installations have valid COCs to protect tenants and meet legal obligations.

### Safety Inspections
Even without legal requirements, it's wise to get your gas installation inspected every 2-3 years for safety and peace of mind.

## Gas COC Requirements in South Africa (300 words)

To obtain a valid gas Certificate of Compliance in South Africa, your installation must meet these requirements:

### SANS 10087-1 Standards
All installations must comply with SANS 10087-1, the South African National Standard for gas installation. This covers everything from pipe sizing to ventilation requirements.

### Qualified Installer
Only SAQCC Gas registered installers can issue COC certificates. We are qualified and authorized to perform inspections and issue compliant certificates.

### Proper Documentation
The COC must include:
- Detailed description of all gas appliances
- Installation date and location
- Test results and pressure readings
- Installer's registration details
- Property owner information
- Detailed inspection checklist

### Physical Inspection
A thorough on-site inspection is required. We cannot issue a COC without physically inspecting your installation.

### Safety Tests
Multiple tests are performed:
- Leak detection using soap solution or electronic detectors
- Pressure drop tests
- Ventilation adequacy checks
- Appliance operation verification
- Gas flow rate measurements
- Connection integrity tests

### Photographic Evidence
Photos of the installation are taken and attached to the COC documentation.

## Gas COC for Property Sales in Gauteng (300 words)

Selling a property with gas installations? Here's what you need to know about gas COC requirements:

### Legal Requirement
The Occupational Health and Safety Act requires sellers to provide buyers with a valid electrical COC and, if gas is installed, a valid gas COC. This is non-negotiable - no COC means no transfer.

### Timing Requirements
- The COC must be issued within 2 years of the sale date
- Some conveyancers and banks prefer COCs less than 1 year old
- Plan to get your COC early in the sales process to avoid delays

### Who Pays?
Traditionally, the seller pays for the gas COC, but this can be negotiated in the offer to purchase.

### Impact on Property Value
A valid, recent COC can:
- Speed up the sale process
- Demonstrate property maintenance
- Give buyers confidence
- Prevent sale delays or cancellations

### Common Sale Delay Causes
Many property sales are delayed because:
- Sellers didn't know they needed a gas COC
- Existing COCs are too old or invalid
- Gas installations fail inspection and need repairs
- Last-minute COC rush causes scheduling issues

### Our Service for Sellers

## Frequently Asked Questions About Gas COC (400 words)

### How long is a gas COC valid?
Gas COCs don't technically "expire," but for property sales, they must be issued within 2 years of the transfer date. For safety, we recommend re-inspection every 2-3 years.

### Can I do my own gas installation and get someone to issue a COC?
No. Gas installations must be performed by SAQCC Gas registered installers. A registered installer cannot issue a COC for work they didn't perform unless they assume full responsibility for the installation.

### What if I don't have a gas COC for my property sale?
The property transfer will not proceed. Conveyancers and banks require the COC before registration. Get your COC sorted early to avoid delays.

### Can I install gas appliances myself?
Absolutely not. Gas installation is dangerous and illegal without proper qualifications. Only SAQCC Gas registered installers may install gas appliances and issue COCs.

### Do I need a separate COC for each appliance?
No. One gas COC covers all gas appliances and installations on the property. However, the COC must list and include inspection results for every gas appliance.

### What happens if there's a gas leak?
If we discover a gas leak during inspection, we'll immediately:
1. Shut off the gas supply
2. Identify the leak source
3. Provide emergency repair options
4. Not issue COC until the leak is fixed

Gas leaks are serious safety hazards - never ignore them.

### Can you provide a COC for an old installation?
Yes, as long as the installation passes current safety standards. Age doesn't matter if the installation is safe and compliant.

### What if I've lost my gas COC?
If we issued your original COC, we can provide a duplicate. If another installer issued it, contact them for a copy.

### Do gas braais need COCs?
Yes, all permanently installed gas appliances, including built-in braais, require COC certification.

### How do I know if my gas installer is qualified?
Ask to see their SAQCC Gas registration card. Registered installers have unique registration numbers. You can verify registration on the SAQCC Gas website.
