## What is a Gas Geyser? (300 words)

A gas geyser, also known as an instant gas water heater or tankless water heater, heats water on demand as it flows through the unit. Unlike electric geysers that store and constantly heat large volumes of water, gas geysers only heat water when you turn on a hot tap.

### How Gas Geysers Work

When you open a hot water tap:
1. Water flows through the gas geyser
2. A flow sensor detects the water movement
3. The gas burner ignites automatically
4. Water passes through a heat exchanger and is instantly heated
5. Hot water flows to your tap within seconds
6. The burner switches off when you close the tap

This on-demand system means you only pay for the hot water you actually use, making gas geysers significantly more energy-efficient than traditional electric geysers.

### Types of Gas Geysers

**Indoor Gas Geysers:**
- Installed inside (bathroom, kitchen, utility room)
- Require proper ventilation via flue pipe
- More compact and weather-protected
- Ideal for homes with space constraints

**Outdoor Gas Geysers:**
- Mounted on exterior walls
- No flue pipe required (open-vented)
- Weather-resistant casing
- Easier installation in some cases

Both types provide excellent performance. We'll recommend the best option for your specific situation during our free on-site assessment.

## Gas vs Electric Geyser: Cost Comparison (300 words)

Wondering if switching to gas is worth it? Here's the reality:

### Purchase & Installation Costs:
- **Electric Geyser:** R2,000-R4,000 (geyser) + R800-R1,500 (installation) = R2,800-R5,500
- **Gas Geyser:** R4,500-R9,000 (geyser) + R1,500-R3,000 (installation) = R6,000-R12,000

**Initial Investment:** Gas geysers cost more upfront (roughly double).

### Running Costs:
This is where gas geysers shine:

**Electric Geyser (150L, 3kW element):**
- Average usage: 3-4 hours per day heating
- Daily electricity: 9-12 kWh
- Monthly cost (at R2.50/kWh): R675-R900
- Annual cost: R8,100-R10,800

**Gas Geyser (16 LPM):**
- Only heats when in use
- Average monthly gas: 20-30kg LPG
- Monthly cost (at R25/kg): R500-R750
- Annual cost: R6,000-R9,000

**Annual Savings:** R2,000-R4,000 per year

### Payback Period:
The higher upfront cost is recovered in just 18-24 months through energy savings. After that, it's pure savings year after year.

### Additional Benefits:
- **Loadshedding-proof:** Hot water during power outages
- **Space saving:** No bulky storage tank
- **Longer lifespan:** Gas geysers last 15-20 years vs 10-12 years for electric
- **Endless supply:** Never run out mid-shower

**Bottom Line:** Gas geysers cost more initially but save money long-term while providing superior performance and reliability.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Gas Geyser Installation (300 words)

### What size gas geyser do I need?
Size depends on simultRetrySContinuemarkdownaneous hot water usage. For a typical home:
- 1-2 people, 1 bathroom: 12-14 LPM
- 3-4 people, 2 bathrooms: 16-18 LPM
- 5+ people, 3+ bathrooms: 20+ LPM

We assess your needs during our free consultation to recommend the perfect size.

### Can I install a gas geyser myself?
No. Gas geyser installation must be performed by SAQCC Gas registered installers. DIY installation is illegal, dangerous, and voids warranties. Only qualified installers can issue the mandatory COC.

### How long does gas geyser installation take?
Most installations are completed in 3-4 hours. Complex installations with long gas line runs may take 5-6 hours. We complete most jobs in a single day.

### Do I need a gas supply line?
Yes. If you don't have an existing gas supply, we can install one from your gas bottle or bulk LPG tank. This adds to installation cost but is a one-time expense.

### Where should a gas geyser be installed?
Indoor units go in bathrooms, kitchens, or utility rooms with proper ventilation. Outdoor units mount on exterior walls near hot water usage points. We'll recommend the best location during assessment.

### Will a gas geyser work during loadshedding?
Yes! Gas geysers don't need electricity to operate (though some models use minimal power for electronic ignition). You'll have hot water even during power outages.

### How long do gas geysers last?
With proper maintenance, gas geysers last 15-20 years, longer than electric geysers (10-12 years).

### What maintenance do gas geysers need?
Annual servicing includes:
- Cleaning heat exchanger
- Checking gas pressure
- Inspecting burner and ignition
- Testing safety devices
- Descaling (if needed)

### Are gas geysers safe?
Absolutely, when professionally installed and maintained. Modern gas geysers have multiple safety features including flame failure devices, overheat protection, and pressure relief valves.

### Can I use a gas geyser with solar panels?
Yes, but it may not be necessary. Solar geysers already provide hot water during the day. Gas geysers are typically used as standalone systems or backups for solar.
