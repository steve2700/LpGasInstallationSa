- **4 burners:** 8-12 people regularly
- **6 burners:** 12+ people or frequent large gatherings

### Can I convert my charcoal braai to gas?
Sometimes. Built-in masonry braais can sometimes accommodate gas braai heads, but modification may be needed. We assess each situation individually.

### How much gas does a braai use?
Average 3-hour braai session uses 0.8-1.2kg LPG. A 9kg bottle provides 8-12 braais.

### Where should gas bottles be stored?
Outdoors, in well-ventilated area, away from ignition sources. Never indoors, in garages, or enclosed spaces.

### Can I use my gas braai in the rain?
Yes, quality gas braais are weatherproof. However, cover when not in use to extend lifespan.

### How long do gas braais last?
Quality stainless steel gas braais last 10-15 years with proper maintenance. Cheaper models may last 5-7 years.

### Do I need gas COC for a braai?
Yes, all permanent gas installations including braais require Certificate of Compliance.

### Can I DIY install a gas braai?
No. Gas installations must be performed by qualified SAQCC Gas registered installers. DIY is illegal and dangerous.

### What's better: natural gas or LPG?
Both work excellently. LPG (bottled gas) is more common as most homes don't have piped natural gas. LPG actually burns hotter.

### Can I add a rotisserie to my gas braai?
Many gas braais have optional rotisserie kits available. Some need electrical connection for motor.

### How far from the house should a gas braai be?
Minimum 1m from combustible structures. More distance is better for safety and smoke management.
