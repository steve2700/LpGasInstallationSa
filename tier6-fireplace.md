### Consider Your Space:

**Small Rooms (under 20m²):**

## Frequently Asked Questions (300 words)

### How much does it cost to run a gas fireplace?
A typical gas fireplace costs R4-R6 per hour to operate, or R400-R600 monthly if used 4 hours daily. Much cheaper than electric heating.

### Do gas fireplaces need a chimney?
Most gas fireplaces need a flue (chimney) to expel combustion gases. Flueless models exist but have limitations and strict ventilation requirements.

### Can a gas fireplace heat my whole house?
Gas fireplaces are designed for zone heating (one room or open area). They're not central heating systems, but they effectively heat living areas where you spend most time.

### Do gas fireplaces work during loadshedding?
Most gas fireplaces work without electricity. Models with electronic ignition can usually be lit manually with matches during power outages.

### How long do gas fireplaces last?
Quality gas fireplaces last 15-20 years with proper maintenance. Burners and control systems are serviceable and replaceable.

### Are gas fireplaces safe?
Yes, when professionally installed and properly maintained. Modern gas fireplaces have multiple safety features and produce negligible indoor emissions when correctly installed.

### Can I install a gas fireplace in a bedroom?
Yes, but with important considerations:
- Adequate ventilation required
- Room size matters (minimum requirements)
- Safety features essential
- Professional assessment recommended

### What's the difference between vented and flueless?
Vented (flued) fireplaces expel combustion gases outside via chimney/flue. Flueless fireplaces use catalytic converters and require excellent room ventilation. Vented is generally preferred for safety.

### Do I need a gas COC for a fireplace?
Yes, Certificate of Compliance is legally required for all permanent gas installations including fireplaces.

### Can I DIY install a gas fireplace?
Absolutely not. Gas fireplace installation requires qualified SAQCC Gas registered installers. DIY installation is illegal and extremely dangerous.
